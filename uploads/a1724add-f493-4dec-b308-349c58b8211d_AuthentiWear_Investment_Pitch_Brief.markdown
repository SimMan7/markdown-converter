## 1. The Problem
In 2025, AI-generated videos are increasingly indistinguishable from real human content, eroding trust in digital media. Deepfakes threaten journalism, legal evidence, and personal authenticity, with 70% of consumers expressing concern over fake videos (Statista, 2024). Existing solutions like digital watermarking are easily bypassed, and there’s no user-friendly way to verify video authenticity in real-time.

---

## 2. The Solution: AuthentiWear
AuthentiWear is a smartwatch app for Apple Watch and Garmin watches that authenticates video content as human-generated. It uses cryptographic QR codes, human presence detection, and physical interaction to ensure videos are genuine. The app leverages existing hardware, reducing costs and enabling rapid deployment.

## 3. Market Opportunity
- **Market Size**: The wearable tech market is projected to reach $150 billion by 2032 (Fortune Business Insights, 2024). Apple Watch alone has sold over 100 million units, and Garmin dominates the fitness sector.
